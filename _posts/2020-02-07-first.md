First post for the new blog.

Soon I will flood the internetz thingy with my thoughts on everything I find interesting or irritating. Not specifically focused on anything. Definitely will include my rants on the way we try to demolish our world, the stupidity in thinking that the individual is important and more subjects that will come to mind.

In my daily life I'm a programmer. I develop software. I try to select assignments that feel good.
Programming is not a subject I want to write about. There is an abundance of blogs, vlogs, Q&A's and tweets about programming that already cover everything I could dream off.

So, stay tuned, maybe something will inform you...
